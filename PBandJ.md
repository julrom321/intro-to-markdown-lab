# New ways to make peanut butter and jelly

PB&J is the perfect snack, wether you want one during/after breakfast, lunch or maybe even at midnight. But sometimes, it can start feeling pretty boring after having it one too many times. So here are some new options to spice things up!

1. Bread Selection.
* **Sourdough bread** Adds a tangy twist, balancing the sweetness of the jelly and the richness of the peanut butter.
*  **Baguettes** Light with a crispy crust, French bread gives a satisfying crunch when toasted.
* **PP&J... on a bagel??** Crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, bagels adds a unique depth of flavor, ideal if you're looking to spice up your PB&J.

2. Peanut Butter.
* **Honey Peanut Butter** Already sweetened, this adds a layer of sweetness that pairs nicely with most brands of jelly.
* **Crunchy Peanut Butter** Adds a nutty twist.
* **Nutella/hazelnut spread** Your probably already asking yourself "I thought this was only peanut butter and jelly!!" Be quiet. Nutella is the ideal option if you want to go from plain-old peanutbutter to a sweet, delicious desert.

3. Jelly.
* **Strawberry jelly** Because nothing beats the classic go-to jelly. Pairs well with any Bread and peanutbutter.
* **Marmalade** Just like nutella, it turns itself into a delicious desert.

4. * *Honorable mention:* **Fillings**
* **Granola** Pairs especially wel with crunchy peanut butter.
